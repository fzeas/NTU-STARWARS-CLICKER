This application helps to macro the three buttons that are essential for NTU STARWARS. The 1st button which is to add courses for STAR PLANNERS which eventually lead to a popup. The 2nd button which is the "confirm to add courses for the popup" which eventually lead to addition of the mod that you wish to have. The 3rd button which is the close button for popup. 

This application DOES NOT have error handling. The textbox required an integer input so that it can parse properly and doesn't crash. Also, if the NTU backend inform you that your session has already expired. You only need to refresh the page and start this program again.

F1 is to start the application while F2 return you the coordinate of your mouse cursor which you are supposed to point at the three button, so you can update the coordinate of those buttons in the application.

Hope you get what you want!
